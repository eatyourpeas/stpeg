# Speaker Guidance

## Case Selection

Please work with your lead consultant +/- regional endocrinology lead to select a suitable subject to present. Successful presentations include:

- Rare presentations of common paediatric endocrine problems
- Unusual paediatric endocrine problems
- Children with endocrine abnormalities presenting to other specialties with symptoms masquerading as something else

## Structure

Presenting a case should take in 5 stages:

1. Title with acknowledgements - hospital(s) and clinician(s) involved
2. Disclosure statement if applicable
3. Case presentation
4. Outcome
5. (Brief) review of the topic

## Top Tips and General Style

<p>You have only 10 minutes. Structure the presentation so that every slide counts</p>
</div>

- Don't give the answer away in the title! This is a learning exercise for everyone, so tell an engaging story leading towards a conclusion.
- Stories that are presented need a conclusion and a learning point. If answers are not yet fully known, focus on some aspect of learning that the audience can take away. You can misdirect but not mislead.
- Begin with the case presentation, with key information only. Include important investigations / growth charts - slides should not be too crowded. Leave time for the audience to digest the information - remember they will be hearing it for the first time.
- Once the reveal is made, don't leave the audience wondering. What happened next? If any treatment has been started or referral made, what is the outcome so far?
- Summary of the topic - do not assume the audience know it all. Focus particularly on the aspects of the topic highlighted by the case presentation
- **keep to time** - there will be time for one or two questions only. STPEG prioritizes the cases and there are a lot to get though, so practice beforehand, keep it concise and leave with a clear message or learning point.
- nerves: even the most experienced speakers get nervous. make sure you have rehearsed and timed yourself beforehand, and have a glass of water nearby.
- timekeeping: the chair will signal when you have 5 minutes left.
